# DndStyleDiceRoller
Rolls dice in the DnD style (3d6, 10d8, etc)

This program was inspired by a challenge in the /r/dailyprogrammer subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/8s0cy1/20180618_challenge_364_easy_create_a_dice_roller/

You can either run a single command (e.g. "3d10") or string multiple commands together ("3d10 4d6 12d20"). Multiple commands just need to be separated by spaces.
